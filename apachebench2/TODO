 -- This _does_ build on FreeBSD-4-STABLE
 -- This builds and installs on NetBSD 1.6.2_RC3

This could use devel/apr but I don't to have an dependency, because
using --enable-static-ab.

Or get this to use apr and apr-util included in this source.

I want this to support ipv6 and HTTPS.

Feel free to work on this.
