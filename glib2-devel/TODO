Does it compile on NetBSD-stable and NetBSD-current?

Does it need perl5?

"docs" doesn't compile on FreeBSD-STABLE and is hashed out by
patches/patch-aa in Makefile.in . IMVHO docs should be an optional, extra
package so I don't think this is an error -- they are available via gtk.org
in HTML format.
 
PLIST -- is it complete? Please verify it.
