Changes
=======

1.0.3: This release features a german documentation for Xebece
written by Simon Schwarz and a documentation update in the
english manual written by Dag Rune Sneeggen. Also included are
some smaller bugfixes.

1.0.2: This is a bugfix release. The fonts and fontsize menus have
been fixed.  The PNG export is no longer broken. The beginning of a
manual has been added. The edit menu now aligns with the node context
menu which is especially handy for MacOS users who have only 1-button
mice.

1.0.1: This is a bugfix release. This fixe the move/drag
functionality, which was much too fast for normal use. Additionally
the examples have been updated to better show the features of Xebece.

1.0.0: Initial release of Xebece.
