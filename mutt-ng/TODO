* Rename to "muttng" when moving into the pkgsrc tree
* more tests
* patch-ab is to disable AUTH PLAIN and use CRAM-MD5 with
  libesmtp. Works for me, but should be discussed with
  muttng developers.
* maybe the includes are not correct for all possible
  options.


tested on:
	* NetBSD 3.0_BETA
	* Debian GNU/Linux/pkgsrc (x86/ppc)
	* FreeBSD7 (x86)
